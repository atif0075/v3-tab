## Introduction

<img class="logo" src="../assets/v3-tabs.svg" alt="MarineGEO circle logo" style="height: 200px; width:200px;"/>

The `v3-tab` package is a Vue 3 component that provides a tabbed interface for switching between groups of content. It comes with a simple API and built on top of [Headless UI](https://headlessui.dev/). It is fully unstyled so you can create your own design. However, some example styles are provided to get you started.

## Requirements

This package requires Vue 3.0 or later. Also you need to install [Headless UI](https://headlessui.dev/) package for Vue. It is built on top of Headless UI, so it is required. If you already have Headless UI installed, you can skip to the [Installation](#installation) section.
